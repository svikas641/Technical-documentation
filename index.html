            Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted
            programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming
            approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and
            provides lots of high-level data structures. Python is easy to learn
            yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it
            attractive for Application Development. Python's syntax and dynamic
            typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for
            scripting and rapid application development. Python supports
            multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative,
            and functional or procedural programming styles.

            Python provides us the two ways to run a program: <br />
            <li>Using Interactive interpreter prompt</li>
            <li>Using a script file</li>
            <code
              >print("hello world");<br />
              #here, we have used print() function to print the message on the
              console.<br
            /></code>
            To run this file named as first.py, we need to run the following
            command on the terminal.
            <code>$ python3 first.py</code>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable">
          <header>Variable</header>
          <p>
            Variable is a name that is used to refer to memory location. Python
            variable is also known as an identifier and used to hold value. In
            Python, we don't need to specify the type of variable because Python
            is a infer language and smart enough to get variable type. Variable
            names can be a group of both the letters and digits, but they have
            to begin with a letter or an underscore. It is recommended to use
            lowercase letters for the variable name. Rahul and rahul both are
            two different variables.
          </p>
          <h4>Identifier Naming</h4>
          <p>
            Variables are the example of identifiers. An Identifier is used to
            identify the literals used in the program. The rules to name an
            identifier are given below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The first character of the variable must be an alphabet or
              underscore ( _ ).
            </li>
            <li>
              All the characters except the first character may be an alphabet
              of lower-case(a-z), upper-case (A-Z), underscore, or digit (0-9).
            </li>
            <li>
              Identifier name must not contain any white-space, or special
              character (!, @, #, %, ^, &, *).
            </li>
            <li>
              Identifier name must not be similar to any keyword defined in the
              language.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identifier names are case sensitive; for example, my name, and
              MyName is not the same.
            </li>
            <li>Examples of valid identifiers: a123, _n, n_9, etc.</li>
            <li>Examples of invalid identifiers: 1a, n%4, n 9, etc.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Type">
          <header>Data Type</header>
          <p>
            A variable can hold different types of values. For example, a
            person's name must be stored as a string whereas its id must be
            stored as an integer. Python provides various standard data types
            that define the storage method on each of them. The data types
            defined in Python are given below.

            <li>Numbers</li>

          <header>Keyword</header>
          <p>
            Python Keywords are special reserved words that convey a special
            meaning to the compiler/interpreter. Each keyword has a special
            meaning and a specific operation. These keywords can't be used as a
            variable. Following is the List of Python Keywords.<br />

          <p>
            Python Literals can be defined as data that is given in a variable
            or constant. Python supports the following literals:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>String literals:</h4>
              <p>
                String literals can be formed by enclosing a text in the quotes.
                We can use both single as well as double quotes to create a
                string.
                <code>"Aman" , '12345'</code>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Numeric literals:</h4>
              <p>
                Numeric Literals are immutable. Numeric literals can belong to
                following four different numerical types.
                <code>
                  x = 0b10100 #Binary Literals<br />
                  y = 100 #Decimal Literal <br />
                  z = 0o215 #Octal Literal <br />
                  u = 0x12d #Hexadecimal Literal<br />

                  #Float Literal <br />
                  float_1 = 100.5 <br />
                  float_2 = 1.5e2 <br />

                  #Complex Literal <br />
                  a = 5+3.14j <br />

                  print(x, y, z, u)<br />
                  print(float_1, float_2)<br />
                  print(a, a.imag, a.real)<br
                /></code>

                Output: <br />
                <code
                  >20 100 141 301<br />
                  100.5 150.0<br />
                  (5+3.14j) 3.14 5.0<br

              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Boolean literals:</h4>
              <p>
                A Boolean literal can have any of the two values: True or
                False.<br />
                <code>
                  x = (1 == True)<br />

              <h4>Special literals.</h4>
              <p>
                Python contains one special literal i.e., None. None is used to
                specify to that field that is not created. It is also used for
                the end of lists in Python.<br /><br />
                <code
                  >val1=10 <br />
                  val2=None <br />
                  print(val1) <br />
                  print(val2)<br />
                </code>
                Output: <br />
                10<br />
                None<br />

          <p>
            The operator can be defined as a symbol which is responsible for a
            particular operation between two operands. Operators are the pillars
            of a program on which the logic is built in a specific programming
            language. Python provides a variety of operators, which are
            described as follows.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
            <li>Comparison operators</li>

          <header>Comments</header>
          <p>
            Python Comment is an essential tool for the programmers. Comments
            are generally used to explain the code. We can easily understand the
            code if it has a proper explanation. A good programmer must use the
            comments because in the future anyone wants to modify the code as
            well as implement the new module; then, it can be done easily.
            <br /><br />
            In the other programming language such as C++, It provides the //
            for single-lined comment and /*.... */ for multiple-lined comment,
            but Python provides the single-lined Python comment. To apply the
            comment in the code we use the hash(#) at the beginning of the
            statement or code.
            <code
              ># This is the print statement<br />
              print("Hello Python") <br
            /></code>

            Here we have written comment over the print statement using the
            hash(#). It will not affect our print statement.

          <p>
            Decision making is the most important aspect of almost all the
            programming languages. As the name implies, decision making allows
            us to run a particular block of code for a particular decision.
            Here, the decisions are made on the validity of the particular
            conditions. Condition checking is the backbone of decision making.
            In python, decision making is performed by the following statements.
          </p>
          <h4>If Statement</h4>
          <p>
            The if statement is used to test a specific condition. If the
            condition is true, a block of code (if-block) will be executed.
          </p>
          <h4>If - else Statement</h4>
          <p>
            The if-else statement is similar to if statement except the fact
            that, it also provides the block of the code for the false case of
            the condition to be checked. If the condition provided in the if
            statement is false, then the else statement will be executed.
          </p>
          <h4>Nested if Statement</h4>
          <p>
            Nested if statements enable us to use if ? else statement inside an
            outer if statement.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
          <header>Loops</header>
          <p>
            The flow of the programs written in any programming language is
            sequential by default. Sometimes we may need to alter the flow of
            the program. The execution of a specific code may need to be
            repeated several numbers of times. For this purpose, The programming
            languages provide various types of loops which are capable of
            repeating some specific code several numbers of times. Consider the
            following diagram to understand the working of a loop statement.
          </p>

          <h4>for loop</h4>
          <p>
            The for loop is used in the case where we need to execute some part
            of the code until the given condition is satisfied. The for loop is
            also called as a per-tested loop. It is better to use for loop if
            the number of iteration is known in advance.
          </p>
          <h4>while loop</h4>
          <p>
            The while loop is to be used in the scenario where we don't know the
            number of iterations in advance. The block of statements is executed
            in the while loop until the condition specified in the while loop is
            satisfied. It is also called a pre-tested loop.
          </p>
          <h4>do-while loop</h4>
          <p>
            The do-while loop continues until a given condition satisfies. It is
            also called post tested loop. It is used when it is necessary to
            execute the loop at least once (mostly menu driven programs).
